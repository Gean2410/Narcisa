                    Far off, quivering, it trembled away, <br>
                    On its clear mirror, the foliage lay, <br>
                    Curved, from a forest, offering shade and grace. <br>

                    Earth and sky, undulating, in the cold <br>
                    Canvas merged! The vague lament that flowed <br>
                    Through water, it seemed, from both was told, <br>
                    Unhindered, ululating, endless, forebode! <br>

                    "A common piece of a remote and rugged place," <br>
                    perhaps, but all the charm it did embrace <br>
                    you would feel; its beauty you'd contemplate; <br>
                    with me, you'd hear its silence that speaks, <br>

                    Our cherished childhood's bright frontier? <br>
                    That blissful time, so full of cheer, <br>

                    You were like a little flower, <br>
                    Timidly unfurling your grace, <br>
                    You, a white lily of the dell, <br>
                    Blossomed in your stem's small cell, <br>
                    Radiating golden rosy embrace. <br>

                    Our sky held no clouds in sight, <br>
                    No dawn refused to shine its light, <br>
                    No nymphs in water played their part, <br>
                    No gentle breeze touched the heart, <br>
                    Without bringing forth delight. <br>

                    Aromatic verses, a harmonious dance, <br>
                    You were a syllable of divine romance. <br>

                    How existence would gently smile, <br>

                <p class="lead">

                    In the silence of fragrant nights, <br>
                    When the wave, weeping, kisses the shore, <br>
                    Beneath the trembling brilliance of the stars, <br>
                    I bow my sad, fainting forehead. <br>
                    And I see the passing of chaste shadows <br>
                    From the deliriums of joyous youth; <br>
                    I clutch my heart shattered <br>
                    By the cruel grip of longing. <br>
                    How sweet is the memory of that time <br>
                    When the ground of existence was covered in flowers, <br>
                    When the murmurs of the spheres sang <br>
                    The tempting verses of love! <br>
                    I soared joyfully over rugged hills <br>
                    Chasing after colorful butterflies... <br>
                    The vault of Elysium was so pure, <br>
                    Hanging over dewy meadows!... <br>
                    Today, laughter burns my lips with madness, <br>
                    The fiery gleam in my eyes is feverish: <br>
                    My voice only echoes with plaintive sighs, <br>
                    Thorny brambles line my path. <br>
                    But what does this pain that overwhelms me matter, <br>
                    That separates me from the boisterous songs, <br>
                    When on the gentle wings of poetry, <br>
                    I am lifted to more beautiful realms?!... <br>
                    From the blue sky, from the flowers, from the wandering mist, <br>
                    From fantastical beings, from fragrances, <br>
                    Regions full of enchantment have been created for me, <br>
                    Illuminated by soft flames of golden light! <br>
                    In the silence of fragrant nights, <br>
                    When the wave, weeping, kisses the shore, <br>
                    She teaches me to pray, timid and believing, <br>
                    She warms the fading hope within me. <br>
                    Oh! Blessed is this pain that weighs me down, <br>
                    That separates me from the noisy chants, <br>
                    From afar, I see the throngs that deliriously rejoice, <br>
                    And lose themselves in winding detours!... <br>

                    Now you fly lightly among lilies, <br>
                    Shaking radiance, little angel; <br>
                    And the zephyr sends you a caress, <br>
                    While the stars offer you tender embraces!... <br>

                <p class="lead">

                    But if a white pearl, shed from your glistening lashes, <br>
                    Clings to your face, <br>
                    From your lips, in melodious speech, <br>
                    Rain down sublime idylls! <br>

                <p class="lead">

                    From your mouth, like a ruby pomegranate, <br>
                    Fall a thousand happy, saintly kisses! <br>
                    Your wings of beautiful hues, <br>
                    Ah! Do not tear them on the path of vice! <br>
